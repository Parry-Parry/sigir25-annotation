# How to Add new Runs

Please add new runs into the directories `runs/trec-dl-2019` (for runs passage retrieval runs for the TREC 2019 Deep Learning track) respectively to `runs/trec-dl-2020` (for runs passage retrieval runs for the TREC 2020 Deep Learning track).

Please use a prefix to easily track who is the "maintainer" of a set of runs, right now, we have the following prefixes (we can later re-organize them):

- `dl-19-official-...`: runs submitted to the 2019 edition of DL
- `dl-20-official-...`: runs submitted to the 2020 edition of DL
- `maik-froebe-...`: runs added by maik
